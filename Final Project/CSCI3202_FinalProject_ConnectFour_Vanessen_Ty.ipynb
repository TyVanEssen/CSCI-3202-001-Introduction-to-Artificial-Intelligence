    "You have two options for completing your final project for this course. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Option 1 ####\n",
    "The first option is presented in this notebook and involves implementing a Connect Four game with AB pruning and A* as player strategies. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Option 2 ####\n",
    "The second option is to design your own project that includes any of the algorithms we've discussed throughout the semester, or an algorithm that you're interested in learning that we haven't discussed in class. Your project also needs to include some kind of analysis of how it performed on a specific problem. If you're interested in the design your own project option, you need to discuss your idea with one of the course instructors to get approval. If you do a project without getting approval, you will receive a 0 regardless of the quality of the project. \n",
    "\n",
    "**The rules:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Choose EITHER the given problem to submit OR choose your own project topic. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. If you choose your own project topic, please adhere to the following guidelines:\n",
    "- Send an email to the course instructors before Friday, November 18 at 6pm, with a paragraph description of your project. We will respond within 24 hours with feedback.\n",
    "- The project can include an algorithm we've discussed throughout the semester or an algorithm that you're been curious to learn. Please don't recycle a project that you did in another class. \n",
    "- If you do your own project without prior approval, you will receive a 0 for this project.\n",
    "- Your project code, explanation, and results must all be contained in a Jupyter notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. All work, code and analysis must be **your own**.\n",
    "4. You may use your course notes, posted lecture slides, textbook, in-class notebooks and homework solutions as resources.  You may also search online for answers to general knowledge questions, like the form of a probability distribution function, or how to perform a particular operation in Python. You may not use entire segments of code as solutions to any part of this project, e.g. if you find a Python implementation of policy iteration online, you can't use it.\n",
    "5. You may **not** post to message boards or other online resources asking for help.\n",
    "6. **You may not collaborate with classmates or anyone else.**\n",
    "7. This is meant to be like a coding portion of an exam. So, we will be much less helpful than we typically are with homework. For example, we will not check answers, help debug your code, and so on.\n",
    "8. If you have a question, post it first as a **private** Piazza message. If we decide that it is appropriate for the entire class, then we will make it a public post (and anonymous).\n",
    "9. If any part of the given project or your personal project is left open-ended, it is because we intend for you to code it up however you want. Our primary concern is with the plots/analysis that your code produces. Feel free to ask clarifying questions though.\n",

    "We've provided the humble beginnings of a Connect Four game. You need to fill in this class structure for Connect Four using what we did during class as a guide, and then implement min-max search with AB pruning, and A* search with at least one heuristic function. The class structure includes the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `moves` is a list of columns to represent which moves are available. Recall that we are using matrix notation for this, where the upper-left corner of the board, for example, is represented at (1,1).\n",
    "* `result(self, move, state)` returns a ***hypothetical*** resulting `State` object if `move` is made when the game is in the current `state`. Note that when a 'move' is made, the column must have an open slot and the piece must drop to the lowest row. \n",
    "* `compute_utility(self, move, state)` calculates the utility of `state` that would result if `move` is made when the game is in the current `state`. This is where you want to check to see if anyone has gotten `nwin` in a row\n",
    "* `game_over(self, state)` returns `True` if the game in the given `state` has reached a terminal state, and `False` otherwise.\n",
    "* `utility(self, state, player)` returns the utility of the current state if the player is Red and $-1 \\cdot$ utility if the player is Black.\n",
    "* `display(self)` is a method to display the current game `state`. You get it for free because this would be super frustrating without it.\n",
    "* `play_game(self, player1, player2)` returns an integer that is the utility of the outcome of the game (+1 if Red wins, 0 if draw, -1 if Black wins). `player1` and `player2` are functional arguments that we will deal with in parts **1b** and **1d**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some notes:\n",
    "* Assume Red always goes first.\n",
    "* Do **not** hard-code for 6x7 boards.\n",
    "* You may add attributes and methods to these classes as needed for this problem."

By not pruning on eqality we check the brances that may be ties in some cases but still are valid wins for the other player.

We collate the combination patterns (rows / columns / diagonals) and check for where valid moves could be played and see if we could possibly win on that row given the current state. We can then check the number of pieces needed for that win and report that as the heuristic, we do the same for blocks, limiting them to a value so we don't worry about blocking early. "

    "- Did one player win more than the other?\n",
    "  - The A* player won the most, I put a lot of effort into making it's heuristics strong. In the test cases asked for by this question it will be most performant, I'm not supprised if it wins 100% of the time. AB will also beat out random with quite high frequency, although there will be ties. The A* algorithm is best, followed by AB-Pruning, followed by random. However random notably has a much higher win rate against AB-Pruning and has it's best win rates on smaller game boards. Random players almost never win on a large board.\n",
    "- How often was the game a draw?\n",
    "  - This also depends on the matchup and board size. But generally, the smaller boards and boards with a higher nwin will have a higher tie percentage since the winning states take up less of the total state space. AKA, it's harder to make matches when the board is small since other players can get in your way, and there is more need to do a blocking move. Ideally, A* would find mostly ties against itself, however it is optimizing on the shortness of the game rather than on the winning or not winning. \n",
    "  - A* versus A* should often result in a draw, however both players are optimizing for a short game, and the logic for searching out it's own winnning states could include a better method of assessing when to make a blocking move.\n",
    "- How many moves did each player make? \n",
    "  - On average, these games were over in 5-6 moves when there were somewhat equally skillful opponents, when either AI played against random it was often over in little more than the nwin amount of turns. When we pair A* against AB-Pruning, oftentimes the length of the game is close to filling the entire board. \n",
    "- Were there situations where one player appeared to do better than the other?\n",
    "  - There were a lot of situations where players had a distinct advantage over oneanother:\n",
    "    - Random vs AB-Pruning on a small board, AB-Pruning is generally a very skillful opponent, however it assumes that it's opponent will act rationally. The Random player does anything but that, it manages to only let AB Pruning win ~70% of the time.\n",
    "    - A* vs AB-Pruning, in this case A* will win out almost every time, this is because while AB-Pruning attempts to reason about states it focuses almost entirely on end game positions, however while A* reasons about states, it's looking at the reality of the board and attempting to both make winning moves and blocking moves. It still is gearing towards it's own win, but is also effectively blocking it's opponent.\n",
    "- Given the outcome, are there other heuristics you would like to implement?\n",
    "  - Although I put a lot of effort into tuning the various alorithms, I'd love to spend more time on AB-Pruning and come up with a new method of utility values to differentiate between the non-winning moves better. I think this would help it to find more tied games. I'd also love to spend more time (even though I already spent a lot) on the A* heuristic, currently when it plays against itself it struggles to reason about what the other player will do. My Ideal would be to use an A* framework to find the end states and then implement some sort of pruning on those states. This arises from messing with A* and realizing that while the heuristic guides it towards the end of the game, it doesn't have any ability to reason effectively about the nature of that win."
